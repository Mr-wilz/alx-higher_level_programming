##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### C Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The `main.c` files are used them to test your functions and you don't have to push to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.

What are tuples and how to use them.
When to use tuples versus lists.
What is a sequence.
What is tuple packing.
What is sequence unpacking.
What is the `del` statement and how to use it.

* **0. Print a list of integers** - Write a function that prints all integers of a list. - `0-print_list_integer.py`.
* **1. Secure access to an element in a list** - Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. - `1-element_at.py`.
* **2. Replace element** - Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). - `2-replace_in_list.py`. -
* **3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!** - Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`.
* **4. Replace in a copy** - Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). - `4-new_in_list.py`.
* **5. Can you C me now?** - Write a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string. - `5-no_c.py`.
* **6. Lists of lists = Matrix** - Write a function that prints a matrix of integers. - `6-print_matrix_integer.py`.
* **7. Tuples addition** - Write a function that adds 2 tuples. - `7-add_tuple.py`.
* **8. More returns!** - .Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. - `8-multiple_returns.py`.
* **9. Find the max** - Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list. - `9-max_integer.py`.
* **10. Only by 2** - Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. - `10-divisible_by_2.py`.
* **11. Delete at** - Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. - `11-delete_at.py`.
* **12. Switch** - Complete the source code in order to switch value of `a` and `b`. - `12-switch.py`.
* **13. Linked list palindrome** - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. - `13-is_palindrome.c`, `lists.h`.
* **14. CPython #0: Python lists** - Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists. - `100-print_python_list_info.c`.
