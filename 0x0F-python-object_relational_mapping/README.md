Welcome to our Python Object-Relational Mapping project! üêçüîó

## Introduction
In this project, we bring together the powerful worlds of databases and Python. We will explore two main approaches: 
1. Using the MySQLdb module for direct connection to a MySQL database, allowing seamless execution of SQL queries.
2. Leveraging the SQLAlchemy module for an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach, enabling elegant interaction with databases using Python objects.

## Project Components
### Part 1: MySQLdb Connection
In the initial phase, we dive into the MySQLdb module to establish connections to MySQL databases. This part focuses on executing SQL queries directly within Python, offering a straightforward interface to interact with the database.

### Part 2: SQLAlchemy Integration
In the subsequent stage, we explore the magic of SQLAlchemy. This powerful ORM library allows us to bridge the gap between relational databases and Python objects effortlessly. With SQLAlchemy, database interactions become more intuitive and Pythonic.

## How to Use
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the provided scripts for both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy implementations.
4. Modify the scripts to suit your specific database configurations and SQL queries.
5. Run the scripts to witness the seamless interaction between Python and databases.
