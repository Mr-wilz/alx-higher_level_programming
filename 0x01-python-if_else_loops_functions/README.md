##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo. -
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Shell Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
*   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
*   All your files must be executable.

### C Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions and you don't have to push to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the `number` stored in the variable number is positive or negative. - `0-positive_or_negative.py`.
* **1. The last digit** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`. - `1-last_digit.py`.
* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game** - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. - `2-print_alphabet.py`.
* **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off** - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. - `3-print_alphabt.py`.
* **4. Hexadecimal printing** - Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal. - `4-print_hexa.py`.
* **5. 00...99** - Write a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`. - `5-print_comb2.py`.
* **6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need** - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. - `6-print_comb3.py`.
* **7. islower** - Write a function that checks for lowercase character. - `7-islower.py`.
* **8. To uppercase** - Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. - `8-uppercase.py`.
* **9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important** - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. - `9-print_last_digit.py`.
* **10. a + b** - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. - `10-add.py`.
* **11. a ^ b** - Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value. - `11-pow.py`
* **12. Fizz Buzz** - Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. - `12-fizzbuzz.py`.
* **13. Insert in sorted linked list** - Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. - `13-insert_number.c`, `lists.h`.
* **14. Smile in the mirror** - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (`z` in lowercase and `Y` in uppercase) , not followed by a new line. - `100-print_tebahpla.py`
* **15. Remove at position** - Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”). - `101-remove_char_at.py`.
* **16. ByteCode -> Python #2** - Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` that does exactly the same as the given Python bytecode. - `102-magic_calculation.py`.
