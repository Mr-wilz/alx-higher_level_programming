##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Shell Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
*   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
*   All your files must be executable.

### C Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions and you don't have to push to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


## Project Description
Learn about the Zen of Python.
How to use the Python interpreter.

* **1. Run inline** - Write a Shell script that runs Python code. - `1-run_inline`.
* **2. Hello, print** - Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line. - `2-print.py`.
* **3. Print integer** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line. - `3-print_number.py`.
* **4. Print float** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits. - `4-print_float.py`.
* **5. Print string** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters. - `5-print_string.py`.
* **6. Play with strings** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print `Welcome to Holberton School!`. - `6-concat.py`.
* **7. Copy - Cut - Paste** - Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py). - `7-edges.py`.
