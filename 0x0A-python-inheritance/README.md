# 0x0A Python Inheritance

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the 0x0A Python Inheritance repository! Here, you will find a collection of Python scripts and exercises aimed at deepening your understanding of inheritance in Python.

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical structure within your codebase.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several directories, each containing Python scripts and exercises related to inheritance:

1. `0-lookup`: Contains scripts demonstrating how to access attributes and methods of an object in Python.
2. `1-my_list`: Implements a class `MyList` that inherits from `list` and adds additional functionality.
3. `2-is_same_class`: Contains scripts to check if an object is an instance of a specified class.
4. `3-is_kind_of_class`: Demonstrates checking if an object is an instance of a class or inherited from it.
5. `4-inherits_from`: Shows how to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from a specified class.
6. `5-base_geometry`: Implements a basic geometry class hierarchy.
7. `6-base_geometry`: Builds upon the previous directory to implement more functionality in the geometry classes.
8. `100-my_int`: Implements a class `MyInt` that inherits from `int` and overrides specific behaviors.

Each directory contains detailed README files explaining the purpose of the scripts and how to use them effectively.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0A-python-inheritance.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script or exercise you're interested in.

3. Open the Python script in your preferred editor or IDE.

4. Run the script using Python. For example:
    ```
    python script_name.py
    ```

5. Follow the instructions provided in the script or README file to understand how inheritance is implemented and how to interact with the classes.
